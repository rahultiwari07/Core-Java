The Set interface in Java is part of the Java Collections Framework and represents a collection that does not allow duplicate 
elements. It is an unordered collection and provides various implementations, each with its own characteristics and behaviors. 
Hereâ€™s an exploration of the Set interface, its implementations, and its functionalities.

Overview of Set Interface
Characteristics:

Does not allow duplicate elements.
Does not maintain the order of elements (with the exception of LinkedHashSet).
Allows at most one null element (with the exception of HashSet).
Common Implementations:

HashSet:

Uses a hash table for storage.
Provides constant-time performance for basic operations (add, remove, contains).
Does not guarantee the order of elements.
LinkedHashSet:

Maintains a linked list of the entries in the set, preserving insertion order.
Provides slightly slower performance than HashSet due to the overhead of maintaining the linked list.
TreeSet:

Implements the SortedSet interface.
Stores elements in a sorted (natural order or by a specified comparator).
Provides logarithmic time performance for the basic operations.
Common Operations
Here are some common operations you can perform using the Set interface:

Adding elements: Use add() to insert elements.
Removing elements: Use remove() to delete elements.
Checking for existence: Use contains() to check if an element exists.
Iterating: Use an iterator or enhanced for loop to traverse elements.
Size: Use size() to get the number of elements in the set.
Clearing: Use clear() to remove all elements.
