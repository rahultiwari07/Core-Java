TreeMap is a part of Java's Map interface implementation that provides a sorted map based on the natural ordering of its keys, or according to a custom comparator provided at the time of creation. Unlike HashMap, which does not guarantee any specific ordering of elements, TreeMap guarantees that the keys will always be sorted either in ascending order or according to the provided comparator.

Key Characteristics of TreeMap:
Sorted Order: It sorts the entries in ascending order by default based on their keys.
NavigableMap: TreeMap implements the NavigableMap interface, which provides methods like headMap(), tailMap(), and subMap() to retrieve specific ranges of the map.
Red-Black Tree: Internally, TreeMap is implemented using a Red-Black Tree, which ensures that the tree remains balanced, allowing for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.
Time Complexity: Operations like put(), get(), remove(), and other navigational methods take O(log n) time because of the tree structure.
Null Values: TreeMap allows null values but does not allow null keys.
Key Methods of TreeMap:
put(K key, V value): Inserts a key-value pair into the map, maintaining the sorted order of keys.
get(Object key): Retrieves the value associated with the given key.
remove(Object key): Removes the mapping for a key.
firstKey(): Returns the first (lowest) key.
lastKey(): Returns the last (highest) key.
headMap(K toKey): Returns a view of the portion of the map whose keys are less than toKey.
tailMap(K fromKey): Returns a view of the portion of the map whose keys are greater than or equal to fromKey.

Explanation of the Implementation:
Tree Structure: This implementation uses a binary search tree to maintain the order of the keys. The keys must be comparable (i.e., they must implement the Comparable interface) to maintain the sorted order.

Operations:

put(K key, V value): This method inserts a key-value pair into the map, maintaining the binary search tree's properties. If the key already exists, the value is updated.
get(K key): Retrieves the value associated with a key by traversing the tree, comparing the key at each node.
remove(K key): Deletes a key-value pair from the tree, ensuring the tree remains balanced by handling the case where the node to be deleted has one or two children.
firstKey(): Retrieves the smallest key in the tree.
lastKey(): Retrieves the largest key in the tree.
Binary Search Tree: The structure of the TreeMap is similar to a binary search tree where each node has two children, and the left child is smaller than the parent, and the right child is larger. This structure allows for efficient searches in O(log n) time.

Tree Traversal: To print the TreeMap in order, we use an in-order traversal, which visits the nodes in ascending order based on their keys.

Key Features of Java's TreeMap:
Sorted Map: Ensures that the keys are always sorted.
NavigableMap Interface: Provides additional navigation methods like subMap(), headMap(), and tailMap().
Self-Balancing Tree: Internally, TreeMap uses a Red-Black Tree, which is a self-balancing binary search tree, ensuring that the tree remains balanced for efficient operations.
This simplified version of TreeMap doesn't include all the optimizations and features of Java's TreeMap, such as balancing using a red-black tree, but it demonstrates the core principles of how keys are stored and ordered in the map.
